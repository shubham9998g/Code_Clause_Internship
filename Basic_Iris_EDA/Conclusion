---Dataset Overview
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples across three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
Each sample has four numeric features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

---Key Feature Insights
Petal length and petal width show strong separation between species:
Setosa is clearly separated from the other two species across these features.
Versicolor and Virginica show some overlap, but are still distinguishable.
Sepal length and width provide less distinct separation but still offer useful information, especially for Setosa.

---Distribution Observations
Histograms with KDE curves reveal:
Setosa values are tightly clustered.
Virginica tends to have the highest petal measurements.

---Boxplots highlight:
Petal length and width have distinct median and range values across species.
Setosa has a higher and more stable sepal width compared to others.

---Correlation Analysis
Petal length and petal width are highly correlated (r â‰ˆ 0.96).
Sepal length shows moderate positive correlation with petal features.
Sepal width is weakly or negatively correlated with other features.
